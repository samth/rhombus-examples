# rhombus-examples-class-interop

<!> Warning this example requires a patched version of the Rhombus prototype.

https://github.com/samdphillips/shrubbery-rhombus-0/tree/racket-class

The purpose of this experiment is to **use** (create/invoke methods on) Racket
classes from Rhombus, not necessarily to define Racket classes in Rhombus.
